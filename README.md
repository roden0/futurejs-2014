Web Audio presentation for Future JS Barcelona 2014

About
-----

These are the examples that go with this presentation:  
http://slides.com/jaumesanchez/barcelona-future-js-2014/

The demo uses WebGL with three.js (http://threejs.org/) and Wagner (https://github.com/spite/Wagner).

Wagner is a postprocessing library still in beta, and it has known issues with ANGLE systems. If you run into performance problems or your browser just freaks out, try the demo with #nopost

Most of the sound samples are from around the internet and FreeSound archive. Will update with proper credits.

Use all the code you want, and let me know if you do!
